  Introduction:
    Prototype-UI is a library of user interface components based on the Prototype framework.
    Its aim is to easilly improve user experience in web applications.

    It also provides utilities to help developers.

  Guideline:
    - Prototype conventions are followed
    - Everything should be unobstrusive
    - All components are themable with CSS stylesheets, various themes are provided

  Warning:
    Prototype-UI is still under deep development, this release is targeted to developers only.
